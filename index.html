            The first stop on the greatest vacation was in Tennessee.
            We camped in a National Park named Fall Creek Falls. It is 
            home to the largest waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains.
            The first day of camping we hiked two full trails and took
            pictures at the observatory on a third trail.  We hiked a total
            of 9 miles that day. We intended on staying longer but the heavy
            rain outmatched the worn tents that our friends had brought with
            them. Unwilling to force our companions to sleep in a flooding
            tent. We all decided to pack up camp in the middle of a downpour.
            After packing we made our way to the second destination of our
            vacation around midnight.

        <p>
            The second stop we stayed in a condo in Orlando, Florida.
            We inteded on going to Disney World, but once again our plans
            changed unexpectadly. Due to the rain we went to an indoor Science
            Observatory Center. We drove to beaches and played in the sand and
            ocean where we could find clear weather. Visiting the beaches in Florida
            was something special. We don't often see sand as soft and white as 
            can be found along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.

        <h2 class="title"><b>The Last Stop Before the End of the Great Vacation</b></h2>
        <p>
            The last leg of our adventure was in Louisiana, New Orleans to be more specific, 
            the French Quarter to be even more precise. That day we walked 13 miles in total.
            We saw voodoo museums and gift shops for the occult. We ate local cuisine like
            alligator and framboise. We attempted a visit to Cafe Du Monde, as it s world famous.
            However due to the fact that it is so famous the line to the counter was literally one
            quarter of a mile long. We turned around and decided to find breakfast elsewhere.
